Simple LAMP Docker Compose with PHPMyAdmin

If you're using Windows, you should install WSL2 first and run the Docker in WSL2 Backend.

Read this document: [My Evernote WSL2 Notes](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s679/sh/8ffeb454-d927-fb61-0578-b37ac6945eae/eFgl1wLr9dJvMFLAV-FQMDNUZBGUUAH5SWh-fiK7nsP5L2TwyyGV37VJNQ)

Put `docker-compose.yml` and `docker` folder to your working directory.
(If you want to only use the simplest one, then you can just put `docker-compose(simplest).yml` file to your working directory and rename it to `docker-compose.yml`)

Run with `docker compose up` with your WSL Linux Distribution (You can use Windows Terminal or VS Code Terminal and select Your WSL Linux Distribution)
